# Shortest_Solution_2X2X2_Cube
God number is 20 for a 3X3X3 cube. http://www.cube20.org/ God number is 12 for a 2X2X2 cube. in another word, any starting position can be solved in 12-turns. For a 2X2X2 cube, the shortest path to solve the cube from any starting position is: 1. the starting position is hashed to a number; 2. the solution can be found by an exhaustive search of 6-turns hash table from both starting position and end position(the number meets each other).
